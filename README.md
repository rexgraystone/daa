# Design and Analysis of Algorithms

This repository contains all the C programs that I have executed in my Design and Analysis of Algorithms course for my 3rd Year of Undergrad in Computer Science at Dayananda Sagar University, Bengaluru, India in Q4 2022.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository using the following command:

    ``` bash
        gh repo clone rexgraystone/os
    ```

    or

    ```

2. Change the directory to the cloned repository:

    ``` bash
        cd os
    ```

3. Compile the C program using the following command:

    ``` bash
        gcc <C File Name> -o <Output File Name>
    ```

4. Run the program using the following command:

    ``` bash
        ./<Output File Name>
