# Design and Analysis of Algorithms

This repository contains all the C programs that I have executed in my Design and Analysis of Algorithms course for my 3rd Year of Undergrad in Computer Science at Dayananda Sagar University, Bengaluru, India in Q4 2022.

## List of Programs

| Serial No. | C File Name | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1  | [1_TowerOfHanoi.c](https://github.com/rexgraystone/daa/blob/master/1_TowerOfHanoi.c)  | A C program to implement Tower of Hanoi using recursion. |
| 2  | 2_BinSearch.c  | A program to search for a key element in an array using binary search algorithm. |
| 3  | 3_MergeSort.c  | A C program to sort an array using Merge Sort Algorithm. |
| 4  | 4_QuickSort.c  | A C program to sort an array using Quick Sort Algorithm. |
| 5  | 5_Prims.c  | A C program to find the Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given graph using Prim's Algorithm. |

## Miscellaneous Programs

| Serial No. | C File Name | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1  | M_Factorial.c  | Write a C program to find the factorial of a number using Recursion. |

## How to Run

1. Ensure that you have a C compiler installed on your system. If not, you can download one from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) or using your package manager.

    Examples:
    - Ubuntu -

    ```bash
    sudo apt install gcc
    ```

    - Arch Linux -

    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S gcc
    ```

    - macOS -

    ```bash
    brew install gcc
    ```

    Additionaly, if you are using Windows, follow the steps specified [here](https://www.scaler.com/topics/c/c-compiler-for-windows/).

2. Clone the repository using the following command:

    ``` bash
        gh repo clone rexgraystone/daa
    ```

    or

    ``` bash
        git clone https://github.com/rexgraystone/daa.git
    ```

3. Change the directory to the cloned repository:

    ``` bash
        cd daa
    ```

4. Compile the C program using the following command:

    ``` bash
        gcc <C File Name> -o <Output File Name>
    ```

5. Run the program using the following command:

    ``` bash
        ./<Output File Name>
    ```

### Note

The programs are written in C and compiled using GCC compiler on macOS Ventura 13.0.
